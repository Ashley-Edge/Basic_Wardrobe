## My app idea

I have decided to create an app that stores what garments you have in your wardrobe. It will allow users to add clothes with descriptions into the app, they will be able to view all the garments they have entered, update garments, and delete garments when they no longer wear them. Once I have this app working and unitesting to prove this, I will work on adding a login page that will be person
alised to each user.

I drew inspiration from the 1995 film **Clueless** which features [Cher's Wardrobe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU) With further training, I would love to revisit this project and add the ability to add images.

## Brief

The aim for this individual project is to make a CRUD app with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all the core modules I covered during my first five weeks of training with QA in their 12 weeks DevOps Bootcamp 2021. A CRUD app has Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality.

Requirements for this project are as follows;

- Functioning CRUD application created in Python
- Trello board with expansion on user stories, use cases and to-do lists
- ERD and pipeline diagrams
- Relational  database with at least two tables and a one to many relationship(this version only has one at this stage
- Unit testing with Pytest with high test coverage provided
- Flask HTML front-end website and integrated API's
- Git for Version Controle
- Jenkins as a CI server.
- Risk assessments

## Project Planning

For planning and tracking the progression of my project, I will be using [this Trello](https://trello.com/b/sTnvvxw5/wardrobe-app) Kanban board.
