## My app idea
---
I have decided to create an app that stores what garments you have in your wardrobe. It will allow users to add clothes with descriptions into the app, they will be able to view all the garments they have entered, update garments, and delete garments when they no longer wear them. Once I have this app working and unitesting to prove this, I will work on adding a login page that will be person
alised to each user.

I drew inspiration from the 1995 film **Clueless** which features [Cher's Wardrobe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU) With further training, I would love to revisit this project and add the ability to add images.

## Brief
---
The aim for this individual project is to make a CRUD app with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all the core modules I covered during my first five weeks of training with QA in their 12 weeks DevOps Bootcamp 2021. A CRUD app has Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality.

## Project Planning
